## Documentation for Business Card

Uses HTML and CSS, along with resources from codepen (https://codepen.io/mftaskin/pen/poKGVQq) for the glitch hover effect.
This was my first attempt at using HTML and CSS and creating an actual website, which actually turned out to be an enjoyable experience despite struggles with learning the programs and troubleshooting issues like missing SVGs. 
The business card is a way of contacting me.
