Most of the technology I used for this project were forked from classmate’s repositories or from Lara’s repositories. Lara assisted me heavily with the use of css grids for both mobile and desktop. I used hover effects for the navbar as well as the main icon to change colors and move. My icon’s movements used keyframes in order to animate, and while small I am very proud of it. 

A lot of the feedback I received on my surveys was about the svg’s not being correct, so with Lara’s help we were able to stabilize the landing page and get the icon in place on both pages correctly. Besides that, I myself felt that the top of the main page was very empty, which led to me adding the ghost gif up there as well as my name, since it didn’t appear on the main portfolio page previously.
